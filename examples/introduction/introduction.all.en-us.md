# Introduction

Let's do a brief introduction into major concepts of WebAssembly:

- WebAssembly is a compile-targeted language for running bytecode on the web.
- Relative to Javascript, WebAssembly offers predictable performance.
- WebAssembly runs on: all major web browsers, V8 runtimes like [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and independent Wasm runtimes like [Wasmer](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer).
- WebAssembly has Linear Memory, in other words, one big expandable array. And in the context of Javascript, synchronously accesible by Javascript and Wasm.
- WebAssembly can export functions and constants, And in the context of Javascript, synchronously accesible by Javascript and Wasm.
- WebAssembly, in its current MVP, only handles integers and floats.

With that, let's head back to the [examples page](/) to learn what we can do with Wasm.
